It may be used for specification purposes, for instance serving as a contract in the design of an inter-organizational business process. Typically, not all describable interactions make sense which motivates the study of the realizability problem for a given choreography.

In this paper, we show that realizability can be traced back to the problem of controllability which asks whether a service has compatible partner processes.

We checked 735 industrial business process models from financial services, telecommunications and other domains. We checked these models for soundness (absence of deadlock and lack of synchronization) using three different approaches: the business process verification tool Woflan, the Petri net model checker LoLA and a recently developed technique based on SESE decomposition. We evaluate the various techniques utilized by these approaches with respect to their ability of accelerating the check. Our results show that an average industrial business process model can be checked in a few milliseconds, which enables tight integration of modeling with control-flow analysis. We also briefly compare the diagnostic information delivered by the different approaches.},

A service model is controllable if there exists a partner service such that their composition is free of deadlocks and livelocks. Whereas controllability can be automatically decided, the existing decision algorithm gives no information about the reasons of why a service model is uncontrollable. This paper introduces a diagnosis framework to find these reasons which can help to fix uncontrollable service models.},

@article{LohmannVD_2008_topnoc,
	Abstract = {In Process-Aware Information Systems, business processes are often modeled in an explicit way. Roughly spoken, the available business process modeling languages can be divided into two groups. Languages from the first group are preferred by academic people but shunned by business people, and include Petri nets and process algebras. These academic languages have a proper formal semantics, which allows the corresponding academic models to be verified in a formal way. Languages from the second group are preferred by business people but disliked by academic people, and include BPEL, BPMN, and EPCs. These business languages often lack any proper semantics, which often leads to debates on how to interpret certain business models. Nevertheless, business models are used in practice, whereas academic models are hardly used. To be able to use, for example, the abundance of Petri net verification techniques on business models, we need to be able to transform these models to Petri nets. In this paper, we investigate a number of Petri net transformations that already exist. For every transformation, we investigate the transformation itself, the constructs in the business models that are problematic for the transformation and the main applications for the transformation.},

@article{AalstLMSW_2008_compj,
	Abstract = {To implement an interorganizational process between different enterprizes, one needs to agree on the ``rules of engagement''. These can be specified in terms of a contract that describes the overall intended process and the duties of all parties involved. We propose to use such a process-oriented contract which can be seen as the composition of the public views of all participating parties. Based on this contract each party may locally implement its part of the contract such that the implementation (the private view) agrees on the contract. In this paper, we propose a formal notion for such process-oriented contracts and give a criterion for accordance between a private view and its public view. The public view of a party can be substituted by a private view if and only if the private view accords with the public view. Using the notion of accordance the overall implemented process is guaranteed to be deadlock-free and it is always possible to terminate properly. In addition, we present a technique for automatically checking our accordance criterion. A case study illustrates how our proposed approach can be used in practice.},

Service choreographies provide a view on message exchanges and their ordering constraints from a global perspective. Assuming message sending and receiving as one atomic step allows to reduce the modelers' effort. As downside, problematic race conditions resulting in deadlocks might appear when realizing the choreography using services that exchange messages asynchronously. This paper presents typical issues when desynchronizing service choreographies. Solutions from practice are discussed and a formal approach based on Petri nets is introduced for identifying desynchronizable choreographies.},

	Abstract = {WS-BPEL defines a standard for executable processes. Executable processes are business processes which can be automated through an IT infrastructure. The WS-BPEL specification also introduces the concept of abstract processes: In contrast to their executable siblings, abstract processes are not executable and can have parts where business logic is disguised. Nevertheless, the WS-BPEL specification introduces a notion of compatibility between such an under-specified abstract process and a fully specified executable one. Basically, this compatibility notion defines a set of syntactical rules that can be augmented or restricted by profiles. So far, there exist two of such profiles: the Abstract Process Profile for Observable Behavior and the Abstract Process Profile for Templates. None of these profiles defines a concept of behavioral equivalence. Therefore, both profiles are too strict with respect to the rules they impose when deciding whether an executable process is compatible to an abstract one. In this paper, we propose a novel profile that extends the existing Abstract Process Profile for Observable Behavior by defining a behavioral relationship. We also show that our novel profile allows for more flexibility when deciding whether an executable and an abstract process are compatible.},

Additionally, we show how the verification techniques can be used to generate a stub process for a partner taking part in a choreography. This is especially useful when the behavior of one participant is intended to follow the corresponding requirements of the other participants. Thus, the missing participant behavior can be generated and the error-prone design of that participant can be skipped.},

	Abstract = {Service orientation is a means for integrating across diverse systems. Each resource, whether an application, system, or trading partner, can be accessed as a service. The resulting architecture, often referred to as SOA, has been an important enabler for interorganizational processes. Apart from technological issues that need to be addressed, it is important that all parties involved in such processes agree on the "rules of engagement". Therefore, we propose to use a contract that specifies the composition of the public views of all participating parties. Each party may then implement its part of the contract such that the implementation (i.e., the private view) accords with the contract. In this paper, we define a suitable notion of accordance inspired by the asynchronous nature of services. Moreover, we present several transformation rules for incrementally building a private view such that accordance with the contract is guaranteed by construction. These rules include adding internal tasks as well as the reordering of messages and are therefore much more powerful than existing correctness-preserving construction rules.},

	Abstract = {On the one hand, Petri net models have a successful history in the modeling, simulation, and verification of workflows and business processes. On the other hand, BPEL is the de facto standard for describing executable Web service-based business processes. With abstract BPEL processes, BPEL can also be used as modeling language. However, being a complicated language with many syntactic constraints, abstract BPEL processes impede a straightforward modeling.

In this paper, we introduce a fully-automatic translation of Petri net models into abstract BPEL processes which can be refined to executable BPEL processes. This approach combines strengths of Petri nets in modeling and verification with the ability to execute BPEL processes. Furthermore, it completes the Tools4BPEL framework to synthesize BPEL processes which are correct by design.},

	Abstract = {WS-BPEL defines a standard for executable business processes. Executable processes are business processes which can be automated through an IT infrastructure. The WS-BPEL specification also introduces the concept of abstract processes: In contrast to their executable siblings, abstract processes are not executable and can have parts where business logic is disguised. Nevertheless, the WS-BPEL specification introduces a notion of compatibility between such an under-specified abstract process and a fully specified executable one. Basically, this compatibility notion defines a set of syntactical rules that can be augmented or restricted by profiles. So far, there exists two of such profiles: the Abstract Process Profile for Observable Behavior and the Abstract Process Profile for Templates. None of these profiles defines a concept of behavioral equivalence. Therefore, both profiles are too strict with respect to the rules they impose when deciding whether an executable process is compatible to an abstract one. In this paper, we propose a novel profile that extends the existing Abstract Process Profile for Observable Behavior by defining a behavioral relationship. We also show that our novel profile allows for more flexibility when deciding whether an executable and an abstract process are compatible.},

	Abstract = {Die Temporal Logic of Distributed Actions (TLDA) ist eine neue temporale Logik miteiner Halbordnungssemantik und eignet sich somit zur Spezifikation verteilter Systeme. Allerdings existieren f{\"u}r TLDA noch keine Werkzeuge, die die Spezifikation und Verifikation unterst{\"u}tzen. Die Verf{\"u}gbarkeit solcher Werkzeuge tr{\"a}gt jedoch entscheidend zur Verbreitung der Logik bei. In [Loh05] wurde mit der Ausarbeitung und Implementierung einer schrittbasierten Interleavingsemantik f{\"u}r TLDA die Grundlage f{\"u}r die Entwicklung eines expliziten TLDA-Modelcheckers gelegt. Der genaue Zusammenhang zwischen der Halbordnungs- und Interleavingsemantik wurde jedoch nicht bewiesen. Au{\ss}erdem handelt es sich bei der Implementierung der Interleavingsemantik um einen Brute-Force-Prototyp, der nur f{\"u}r sehr einfach Spezifikationen in der Lage ist das Transitionssystem zu konstruieren. Die formale Fundierung sowie die Ausarbeitung effizienter Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen ist Inhalt dieser Arbeit. Anhand mehrerer Fallstudien untersuchen wir die Leistungsf{\"a}higkeit des erweiterten Prototyps und illustrieren die Beziehung zwischen der Halbordnungs- und Interleavingsemantik.},

@mastersthesis{Lohmann_2005_sa,
	Abstract = {Die Temporal Logic of Distributed Actions (TLDA) ist eine temporale Logik mit einer Halbordnungssemantik und eignet sich somit zur Spezifikation verteilter Systeme. Allerdings gibt es noch wenig Erfahrung bei der computergest{\"u}tzten Verifikation halbordnungsbasierter Formalismen. Viele bekannte effiziente Algorithmen des expliziten Modelchecking setzen ein Transitionssystem und somit eine Interleavingsemantik voraus. In dieser Arbeit wird eine Interleavingsemantik f{\"u}r TLDA vorgeschlagen und ein Prototyp entwickelt, der f{\"u}r eine bestimmte Klasse von TLDA-Spezifikationen das Transitionssystem aufbaut. Die entwickelte Semantik soll zusammen mit dem Prototypen die Grundlage f{\"u}r die weitere Arbeit an einem Modelchecker f{\"u}r TLDA sein.},
