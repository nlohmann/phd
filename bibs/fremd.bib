@article{GierdsMW_2010_tcs,
	Abstract = {Service-oriented computing aims to create complex systems by composing less-complex systems, called services. Since services can be developed independently, the integration of services requires an adaptation mechanism for bridging any incompatibilities. Behavioral adapters aim to adjust the communication between some services to be composed in order to establish proper interaction between them. We present a novel approach for specifying such adapters, based on domain-specific transformation rules that reflect the elementary operations that adapters can perform. We also present a novel way to synthesize complex adapters that adhere to these rules, viz., by consistently separating data and control, and by using existing controller-synthesis algorithms. Our approach has been implemented, and we discuss some example applications, including real business processes in WS-BPEL.},

Existing sources of com-ponents --- manufacturers, software houses, users' groups and algorithm collections --- lack the breadth of interest orcoherence of purpose to assemble more than one or two members of such families, yet software production in the largewould be enormously helped by the availability of spectra of high quality routines, quite as mechanical design is abet-ted by the existence of families of structural shapes, screws or resistors. The talk will examine the kinds of variabilitynecessary in software components, ways of producing useful inventories, types of components that are ripe for suchstandardization, and methods of instituting pilot production.},

	Abstract = {This is an tutorial-review paper on Petri nets. It
                 starts with a brief review of the history and the
                 application areas considered in the literature. It then
                 proceeds with examples, behavioral and structural
                 properties, methods of analysis, subclasses of Petri
                 nets and their analysis. The paper contains a section
                 devoted to marked graphs and presents introductory
                 discussions on stochastic nets and on high-level nets.
                 Also included are recent results on reachability
                 criteria.},

	Abstract = {A choreography describes the interaction between services. It may be used for specification purposes, for instance serving as a contract in the design of an inter-organizational business process. Typically, not all describable interactions make sense which motivates the study of the realizability problem for a given choreography.

In this paper, we show that realizability can be traced back to the problem of controllability which asks whether a service has compatible partner processes. This way of thinking makes algorithms for controllability available for reasoning about realizability. In addition, it suggests alternative definitions for realizability. We discuss several proposals for defining realizability which differ in the degree of coverage of the specified interaction.},

	Abstract = {The internet today has grown to be more than just being a basis for exchanging information. It steadily becomes a platform for processing business processes. Many companies distribute their service with the help of web services or integrate other web services into their own workflow. However, before a web service gets published it should be examined well. We will introduce a way of examining the controllability of a web service. That means, we study whether a controller can actually use the functionality provided by the web service. We propose the interaction graph of a web service, that is modelled by an open workflow net. To verify whether such a net is controllable or not it is sufficient to construct a reduced interaction graph. We will define reduction rules that minimize the size of the graph greatly. The analysis using the interaction graph as well as the reduction rules shown in this paper are implemented and have been integrated into an analysis tool kit for web services.},

	Abstract = {Compatibility of behavior, i.e. the correct ordering of messages, is one of the core aspects for the interaction between services as parts of an inter-organizational business process. In previous work, we proposed formal representations for service behavior (including Petri nets and service automata) and finite representations of sets thereof (operating guidelines). 

In this article, we show how the basic set operations union, intersection, and complement, as well as membership and emptiness tests, can be implemented on finite representations of (typically infinite) sets of services. We motivate the operations by three examples of applications -- service substitution, selection of behavior, and navigation in a behavioral registry.},

	Abstract = {Choreographies offer means to describe the long-running
collaboration of
     business partners. Such descriptions can be used to create new
participant
     processes which comply to the overall choreography or to check whether
     participating processes conform to the protocol. In addition,
choreography
     descriptions allow for asserting whether a completed
cross-organizational
     conversation has been compliant to the planned choreography. However,
     choreography descriptions have so far not been used during execution
but only
     during design time. Therefore, it is not yet possible to immediately
detect
     protocol violations and to instantly handle such violations. In this
paper we
     motivate the need of a Choreography-aware Service Bus which is capable
of
     tracking the soundness of cross-organizational conversations while
they are
     running. This fosters a novel notion of exception handling in the
context of
     choreographies.},

Providing a simple interface was a major design goal such that it is as easy as possible to integrate LoLA into tools of different application domains. LoLA supports place/transition nets. Implemented verification techniques cover standard properties (liveness, reversibility, boundedness, reachability, dead transitions, deadlocks, home states) as well as satisfiability of state predicates and CTL model checking. For satisfiability, both exhaustive search and heuristically goal oriented system execution are supported. For state space reduction, LoLA features symmetries, stubborn sets, and coverability graphs.},

	Abstract = {Controllability for service models is a similar criterion as soundness for workflow models: it establishes a necessary condition for correct behavior of a given service model. Technically, controllability is the problem to decide, for a given service, whether it can interact correctly with at least one other service. Parameters to the problem are the established correctness criterion (e.g. deadlock freedom, livelock freedom, quasi-liveness), the shape of partners (centralized partners versus independently acting partners), or the shape of communication (asynchronous versus synchronous).

In this article, we survey and partly extend various recent results concern- ing the verification of controllability for Petri net based service models. Significant extensions include the study of livelock freedom as correctness criterion as well as the new results on autonomous multi-port controllability.},
